TODO List for Qiptables project

1) Add check for root user id when calling exec in IpProcess
Note exec will need to be overriden to include check for
root access before calling parent class exec method.

2) use a directory structure under ~/.qiptables to store
different rulesets - Maybe store all rules in sqlLite database
and just extract them as required. Would make it easier to handle 
rulesets.

3) Use SqlLite database for storing default rulesets

4) provide ruleset snippets for things such as ssh, VNC, MS Network,
Samba, Flood attacks etc
